# C3 Group Coding Challenge
Create a random raffle picker!

We'll be choosing a winner for our C3 gift certificates and need your help to come up with a tool that does the following:

- Create a webpage where we can run a function to select the winner.
- Display a count of all meeting participants.
- Randomly choose one member from the list and display their name after running the function.

A full list of participants can be obtained from https://c3-group.herokuapp.com/groups

See the image below for an example of our final product.
